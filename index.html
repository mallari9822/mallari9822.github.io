                        primarily using Kotlin and Java for the Android platform, the app provides a smooth, native user
                        experience focused on educational engagement. It serves as a comprehensive tool for
                        self-assessment, covering key academic and general knowledge subjects.</p>

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is a robust, modular web application designed to
                        manage event listings, user registrations, and administrative tasks. The system focuses heavily
                        on backend architecture, utilizing a comprehensive set of API routes to handle everything from
                        viewing events to confirmed registrations. The system is architecturally notable for its
                        multi-layered security model, which accommodates public access, general user registration,
                        specialized presale access, and secure administrator control, with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as the
                        primary authentication mechanism for users.</p>

                    <ul class="responsibilities">
                        <li>JWT Authentication: Users are authenticated using secure, stateless JSON Web Tokens
                            (JWT) stored in httpOnly cookies.</li>
                        <li>Career Application Module: Dedicated public routes for displaying the career form and
                            securely submitting job applications with resume uploads.</li>
                        <li>Multi-Role Access Control: Clearly defined and protected API routes govern four distinct
                            user tiers: Public, Authenticated User, Presale Invitees, and Administrator.</li>

                <div class="reflection">
                    <strong>Reflection:</strong> The heart of this project was the challenge of building a secure,
                    seamless user experience in the backend. I learned that security isn't just about locks; it's about
                    architecture. Mastering JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was the key—it allowed me to create a stateless,
                    scalable system that could handle thousands of user logins without bogging down the server with
                    sessions. Implementing the JWT flow, from secure creation to validation via httpOnly cookies,
                    solidified my understanding of modern, distributed authentication. This focused work on the JWT
                    security model and the subsequent design of complex, multi-role API endpoints showcases my
                    commitment to building high-performing, user-focused, and robust backend services.

                    <strong>Reflection:</strong> Developing this application in Flutter and Dart allowed for
                    cross-platform deployment, which was essential for reaching a broad research participant base
                    quickly. This project showcases my ability to develop highly functional applications that adhere to
                    strict ethical and
                    data privacy standards. This project is currently in progress, demonstrating my commitment to
                    continuous development, security hardening, and iterative feature integration within a rigorous
                    research framework.
